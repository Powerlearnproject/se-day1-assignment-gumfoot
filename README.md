#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software engineering is the practice of designing, developing, testing and maintaining software systems. It is essentially the core of innovation and functionality, facilitating the creation of reliable and scalable solutions that meet evolving business and individual needs.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

1. The Software Crisis - for a period during the 1960s to the 1980s, there were various higlighted challenges of developing reliable, efficient software that led to the establishment of software engineering as a discipline.
2. Introduction of Structured Programming - characterized by the introduction of systematic approaches to coding as well as teh emergence of languages such as C.
3. Rise of Agile Methodologies - this trend promoted iterative processes and collaboration as well as adaptability, thus transforming software development.



List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

1. Requirement Analysis - this phase is for the gathering and analysis if business or user requirements to understand what the software needs to achieve.
2. Planning - in this phase, roadmaps for development are created and this sets the foundation for efficient execution.
3. Design - this phase involves developing detailed designs that define the structure and the components of the software.
4. Development - this phase, also known as the coding phase, involves translating the designs from the previous step into functional code by help of a programming language and framework.
5. Testing - in this phase, the software is validated by identifying and fixing defects, or bugs, to ensure it performs as required.
6. Deployment - the software is released in this step to the users or the production environment, thus making it functional for its intended purpose.
7. Maintenance - this involves monitoring, updating and improving the software in order to fix issues or enhance performance.



Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

The Waterfall methodology uses a linear approach where each phase is completed before moving on to the next. It can be used in a scenario where software is being developed for a medical device, where teh requirements must be precise and where documentation is necessary.
Agile methodology, on the other hand, has a flexible approach where development happens in short cycles. It can be used in a scenario of developing an e-commerce website, where user preferences may shift. 



Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

A Software Developer designs, codes and implements software solutions. They also debug and troubleshoot the software as well as collaborating with members of their team to add more features and functionality.
A Quality Assurance Engineer's main focus is ensuring and maintaining the quality and reliability of the software by validating functionality. They perform different tyoes of testing.
A Project Manager's role is to oversee the whole project, ensuring that it is completed on time and within scope and budget. They also facilitate communication among team members and stakeholders.



Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

Integrated Development Environments provide developers with a set of tools in a single platform. They improve a developer's efficiency by allowing them to write, test and debug code all in the same application. An example includes Visual Studio Code.
Version COntrol Systems enables the development team to track changes over time, making it simple to revert to a previous version if need be. They also facilitate collaboration by enabling multiple developers to work on the same project at the same time. An example includes Git.



What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Common challenges that software engineers face include;
1. Understanding complex requirements - any misunderstandings can lead to massive delays or even rework. This can be solved by collaborating with stakeholders to gather and document detailed requirements.
2. Dealing with tight deadlines - high pressure deadlines can lead to burnout or a reduced quality of code. A solution to this would be to break down tasks into manageable sprints and to prioritize them based on their importance.
3. Keeping up with rapidly changing technology - new languages, tools and frameworks frequently emerge and it can be difficult for developers to keep up. The solution would be to dedicate time for continuous learning through either workshops, bootcamps or self-study.



Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

Unit Testing - this type of testing focuses on the individual components of the software. They are tested in isolation to verify they work correctly. This enables developers to detect and fix bugs at an early stage.
Integration Testing - this testing focuses on the interactions between components to ensure they work together seamlessly.
System Testing - this type of testing evaluates the entire system as a whole to ensure that it meets the requirements and performs as it should. This verifies that the software behaves as expected in real-world scenarios.
Acceptance Testing - this test determines if the software meets the criteria set by the client or the end-user and is ready to be deployed.



#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompt engineering is the practice of crafting clear and specific, effective instructions to optimize interactions with AI models. This unlocks the full potential of AI, enabling it to perform all manner of tasks.



Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Vague prompt : Explain something about cats.
Improved prompt : Explain what kind of animal a cat is, describe its behaviour and give examples of cat species.
The improved prompt is more effective because it provides specific areas of focus and gives specific instructions.
